Core (OPTIONAL)
1. Add option to use custom PIDProfile for generally moving using builder

Plan for line following
1. Configure min error of PIDMotor to set integral to 0
2. Make it so that the chassis must wait a certain amount of time to adjust (when it is within margin of error) before 
exiting the stall
3. MKAE EXTRAAA sure that Chassisbuilder can create multiple motor instances (cloning) so that you can use Build() multiple times.
3. Define a XLineFollowerBot or something; Pass in XAutoChassis
4. Have the XLineFollowerBot go as straight as possible (and maybe add conditions for it to stop running)





FOR later use
1. Implement functions in new class Chassis, that allows you to set the speed of all motors manually (Turn, forward)
2. Map controller joysticks to chassis
3. Define ChassisBuilder
	Option for Slew, other stuff

4. If you're bored use ChassisBuilder in AutoChassisBuilder
