Core (OPTIONAL)
1. Add option to use custom PIDProfile for generally moving using builder

TODO
* Decide how we are going to enforce chassis stalling / not stalling in XLineFollower
* Test how accurate traveling forward and backwards is;
	* Determines whether or not picking up blocks is distance or detection based
* Use smart pointers for ownership issues
* Have ChassisBuilder() in XLineFollowerBuilder to configure builder instead


Challenges to overcome
* Move a specific amount (DONE)
* Turn a certain angle (DONE)
* Follow a line a certain distance
* Detect a corner 
* Pick up block
* Hold arm in position



FOR later use
1. Implement functions in new class Chassis, that allows you to set the speed of all motors manually (Turn, forward)
2. Map controller joysticks to chassis
3. Define ChassisBuilder
	Option for Slew, other stuff

4. If you're bored use ChassisBuilder in AutoChassisBuilder
