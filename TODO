Core (OPTIONAL)
1. Add option to use custom PIDProfile for generally moving using builder
2. Clean up PID variant code; It's yucky



Plan for line following
1. Configure min error of PIDMotor to set integral to 0

2. Add reset() to chassis builder
3. Define a XLineFollowerBot or something; Pass in XAutoChassis
4. Have the XLineFollowerBot go as straight as possible (and maybe add conditions for it to stop running)

FOR later use
1. Implement functions in new class Chassis, that allows you to set the speed of all motors manually (Turn, forward)
2. Map controller joysticks to chassis
3. Define ChassisBuilder
	Option for Slew, other stuff

4. If you're bored use ChassisBuilder in AutoChassisBuilder
