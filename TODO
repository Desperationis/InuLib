Challenges to overcome
* Move a specific amount (DONE)
* Turn a certain angle (DONE)
* Follow a line a certain distance
* Pick up block (DONE
* Hold arm in position (DONE)




Library issues that need to be addressed:
* How to move chassis asynchronously such that any condition can be applied to the movement
	* Have every single movement in AutoChassis be asynchronous
	* Make synchronous an option

* How to follow a line asynchronously such that any condition can be applied
	* Not necessary since we won't be using camera
	* Only need to add an option to follow a line a certain distance.































FOR later use
1. Implement functions in new class Chassis, that allows you to set the speed of all motors manually (Turn, forward)
2. Map controller joysticks to chassis
3. Define ChassisBuilder
	Option for Slew, other stuff

4. If you're bored use ChassisBuilder in AutoChassisBuilder
